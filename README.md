### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer who works with python 🐍 daily. I'm currently working in the data world. 

🤔 I'm looking for help to understand how to make a correct deployment to a cloud service and how it is related front end and backend.

🌱 My side projects are related to the creation of web applications.

📫 You can reach me my personal [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geeklogbook). 

⚡ Fun fact: You can find me on GoodReads, thinking about literature📚 or dance👯.
